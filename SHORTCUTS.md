- **Add to Queue**: Left-click song (or press Enter) → Add to queue

### Queue List

- **Set Track as Default**: Right-click playing song → Set track as default to save current track selection

## Notes

- **Global Shortcuts**: Most shortcuts work regardless of which control has focus
- **Queue Focus Override**: When the Queue ListView has focus, `Ctrl+↑` and `Ctrl+↓` move songs instead of performing ListView multi-selection
- **Selected Song Required**: Queue movement shortcuts require a song to be selected in the queue
- **Movement Restrictions**: Songs that have already been played (including currently playing) cannot be moved

## Usage Tips

1. **Quick Queue Management**: Use `Ctrl+↑/↓` to fine-tune song order
2. **Priority Songs**: Use `Ctrl+←` to move a song to play next after the current song
3. **Defer Songs**: Use `Ctrl+→` to move songs to the end of the queue
4. **Instant Controls**: Use `Space` for quick pause/resume and `Esc` for immediate stop
7. **Track Selection**: Use `Ctrl+V` to toggle between vocal and instrumental tracks, then right-click playing song → "Set track as default" to save your preference

## Accessibility

All shortcuts are also available through:
- **Toolbar Buttons**: Click buttons in the main toolbar
- **Context Menus**: Right-click on songs in the list or queue
- **Touch/Mouse**: All controls have mouse/touch support for users who cannot use keyboard shortcuts
